# DevConnect

DevConnect is a web app built to help developers discover, follow, and collaborate with each other on open-source projects. Think of it as "LinkedIn meets GitHub" but simplified and targeted for indie devs and small teams.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

I created DevConnect because I wanted a better way to stay connected to people I met at hackathons and local dev meetups. Most developer platforms are either too bloated or too code-focused. This app focuses on lightweight profiles, meaningful connections, and project discovery.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **React** – Built the frontend UI using functional components and hooks.
- **Node.js** – Handled routing and server-side logic.
- **MongoDB** – Used to store user profiles and project info.
- **Tailwind CSS** – For fast, responsive UI styling without the hassle.
